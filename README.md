# Brief

Your challenge is to build this weather app using the Open-Meteo API and make it look as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So, if you have something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a try.

Your users should be able to:

Search for weather information by entering a location in the search bar
View current weather conditions, including temperature, weather icon, and location details
See additional weather metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and precipitation amounts
Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown
Switch between specific temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) and measurement units for wind speed (km/h and mph) and precipitation (millimeters) via the units dropdown
View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
